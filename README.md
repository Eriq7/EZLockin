# EZLockIn (Immersive Study Timer)

A desktop study companion designed to fight **timer anxiety**.  
EZLockIn keeps you focused using two game-inspired mechanics: **randomness** and **rewards**.

---

## Origin & Philosophy

> **Why can games keep people playing for hours, but studying often feels hard to sustain?**  
> Many addictive games rely on two simple mechanics: **Randomness** (curiosity) and **Rewards** (positive feedback).  
> EZLockIn applies the same loop to studying.

### Game Mechanics → EZLockIn Mapping

| Mechanic | In Games | In EZLockIn |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 🎲 **Randomness** | You don’t know what happens next, so your brain stays curious. | Focus session length is randomized (e.g., **3 min**, **5 min**, **3m 15s**). |
| 🎁 **Rewards** | Small wins make you want to repeat the loop. | After each focus session, you get a **10-second reward break**. |

**Result:** a lightweight “game loop” that makes studying feel easier to continue.
